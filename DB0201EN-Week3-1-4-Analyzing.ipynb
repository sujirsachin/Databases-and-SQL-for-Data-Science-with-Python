    "* **Community Area Number** (`ca`): Used to uniquely identify each row of the dataset\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Percent Aged 16+ Unemployed** (`percent_aged_16_unemployed`): Percent of persons over the age of 16 years that are unemployed\n",

    "* **Percent Aged 25+ without High School Diploma** (`percent_aged_25_without_high_school_diploma`): Percent of persons over the age of 25 years without a high school education\n",

    "* **Per Capita Income** (`per_capita_income_`): Community Area per capita income is estimated as the sum of tract-level aggragate incomes divided by the total population\n",

    "* **Hardship Index** (`hardship_index`): Score that incorporates each of the six selected socioeconomic indicators\n",
